# Operations and Recovery

This guide covers steady-state checks, backups, and recovery after the initial
Terraform and Ansible deployment. Run `hermes-vps ...` commands on the VPS;
run Terraform and Ansible from the controller machine.

## Readiness Model

`hermes-vps status` is the operator-facing source of truth. It checks workbench
backup state, off-box freshness, the retention-pruning gate, optional n8n HTTP
and container health, and optional `cloudflared` service state. When configured,
`hermes-vps healthcheck` sends Telegram alerts only on health-state changes.

The intended production n8n posture is public-webhook-only. Cloudflare Tunnel
may expose `/webhook/*`, while the editor, REST API, sign-in routes, SSH, raw VPS
ports, and SQLite database remain private. See
[n8n and Cloudflare Tunnel](n8n-cloudflare.md).

## Operator Commands

```sh
hermes-vps status
hermes-vps timers
hermes-vps release-check
hermes-vps healthcheck
hermes-vps backup
hermes-vps backup-offbox
hermes-vps docker-cleanup
```

- `status` checks the host, backup state, and enabled optional services.
- `timers` lists scheduled backup, cleanup, release, and health jobs.
- `release-check` reports newer stable optional agent-gateway releases without
  upgrading automatically.
- `healthcheck` runs status checks and sends transition alerts when configured.
- `backup` creates an immediate local archive.
- `backup-offbox` copies and checksum-verifies the latest archive when enabled.
- `docker-cleanup` removes unused Docker artifacts without pruning volumes.

## Backup Model

The backup chain is designed as a closed loop:

1. n8n SQLite is backed up online when that profile is enabled.
2. Runtime state is collected into the VPS backup.
3. Sensitive n8n backups are age-encrypted.
4. Archives are copied off-box with rsync over SSH.
5. The remote copy is verified end-to-end with SHA-256.
6. Local retention pruning is allowed only while the verified off-box state is
   fresh.

Until off-box transport is enabled and verified, `hermes-vps status` reports
`backup_retention_prune_disabled_until_offbox_copy` and, when applicable,
`backup_offbox_disabled`. If the off-box target is unavailable, the local
archive remains in place and a retry-pending marker tells the next run which
archive to retry.

A Mac on the same Tailscale network can be a suitable personal off-box target
when it receives already encrypted artifacts. Keep backup archives private;
general VPS archives can contain runtime env files, OAuth state, pairing data,
and service credentials.

## Recovery Model

The VPS is replaceable infrastructure. Persistent state should live in Git
remotes, backups, or explicitly documented storage paths.

The high-level recovery sequence is:

1. Recreate the server and firewall with Terraform.
2. Reapply host configuration and service layout with Ansible.
3. Restore optional service state from backup while services are stopped.
4. Validate health, timers, private access, and optional integrations.
5. Close bootstrap SSH and prove ongoing OpenSSH access over Tailscale.

The full runbook includes file ownership, Firecrawl volume caveats, an isolated
n8n SQLite restore, and a credential-decryption proof that does not print secret
values: [Restore runbook](../references/restore.md).

## Optional Ubuntu Pro / ESM Apps

Ubuntu Pro is an optional manual host-maintenance step, not an Ansible default.
Never store its token in Ansible vars, Terraform vars, committed files, support
bundles, screenshots, chat logs, or persistent shell history.

```sh
sudo hermes-vps status
sudo hermes-vps backup

read -rsp "Ubuntu Pro token: " UBUNTU_PRO_TOKEN; echo
sudo pro attach "$UBUNTU_PRO_TOKEN"
unset UBUNTU_PRO_TOKEN

pro status
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
pro security-status --esm-apps
sudo hermes-vps status
sudo hermes-vps healthcheck

if [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ]; then cat /var/run/reboot-required; else echo no; fi
```

Reboot only when `/var/run/reboot-required` exists, then rerun `status` and
`healthcheck`. If a token appears in chat, screenshots, logs, or support
artifacts, revoke or rotate it in the Ubuntu Pro dashboard.

## Release Context

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) and the
[v1.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/stevenmichiels/dual-agent-vps/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
for the deployment-ready workbench baseline. The
[v0.4.0 release notes](https://github.com/stevenmichiels/dual-agent-vps/releases/tag/v0.4.0)
document the public-webhook/private-editor n8n milestone.
